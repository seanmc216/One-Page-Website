	<p>Brisbane is Australia's third largest city, capital of Queensland on the East coast 450 miles north of Sydney.
		Colloquially known as BrisVegas for its holiday destination reputation, it is also discussed as the Los Angeles
		of
		Australia for its unbeatable climate, fantastic surrounding terrain with world-class beaches and cultural
		similarities.
		Just out of the city to the north and south are the Sunshine and Gold Coasts which contribute massively to
		Brisbane's
		offering of a most desirable lifestyle.</p>
	<p>By outward appearance Brisbane is a modern city, with the echoes of its colonial past observed in the classic
		architecture of the sandstone buildings which now stand side by side with modern towers. Galleries, theaters,
		quality
		shopping, international cuisine and vibrant nightlife provide a dynamic lifestyle.</p>
	<p>To the south is Gold Coast, with its 42km of golden beaches, world class attractions and rainforest hinterland.
		To
		the north is Sunshine Coast, home of the Noosa resort area. The sheltered waters of Moreton Bay are protected
		from the
		rolling surf of the Pacific Ocean by Moreton, North and South Stradbroke Islands and are home to many wildlife
		including
		dolphins, turtles and dugong.</p>
